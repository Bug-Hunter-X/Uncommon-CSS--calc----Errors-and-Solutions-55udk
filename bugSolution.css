The corrected CSS code is as follows:
```css
/*Solution for inconsistent units*/
width: calc(50% + 10vw);

/*Solution for nested calculations*/
width: calc(50% + 10px);
```
The improved version addresses the unit consistency issue in `calc()` by using compatible units (`vw` or `%`) and simplifies nested `calc()` expressions. This increases performance and readability of the code.
